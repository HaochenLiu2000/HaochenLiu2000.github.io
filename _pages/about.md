I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, advised by Professor Jundong Li. I received my B.E. in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2022.

My research interests are Large Language Model (LLM), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Knowledge Graph (KG).
